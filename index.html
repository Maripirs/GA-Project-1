          Rules of the game 
        </h2> 
        <p class="rulesText" >

            The objective of the game is to run out of cards as soon as possible<br/><br/>
            Each player starts the game with 3 cards face down, 3 cards face up and 3 cards in hand<br/>
            In a turn, the active player has to play a card on top of discard pile if possible<br/>
                Rules for playing a card are:<br/>
                    If there are no cards in discard. you can play any card<br/>
                    Otherwise play a card that has a higher value than the card on top of the discard pile.<br/>
                    Highest card for this game is A. 2 and 10 are wild<br/><br/>
            
            After playing a card, if you have fewer than 3 cards in your hand AND there are cards left on the deck, draw a card<br/><br/>

            If you can't play a card, you'll collect the discard pile into your hand, the previous player gets to go again.<br/><br/>
                
            You can only play cards from the table face up when your hand is empty, and you can only play face down cards when you don't have any other cards<br/>
            When playing a face down card, reveal it. If it's a legal play, play as normal, if not, add it into your hand along with the discard pile. Previous player gets another turn. <br/><br/>
            
            Special situations:<br/><br/>
                - 2 is a wild card. It can be played regardless of the number on top of discard. Then play another card<br/>
                - 10 is a wild card. It can be played regardles of the number on top of discard AND it will get rid of current discard pile (trashed). Then play another turn<br/>
                - If the top of the discard pile has 3 or 4 continuous cards of the same value, the discard pile gets trashed and current player gets another turn.<br/>
                - If you have multiple cards of the same value, you can choose to play as many as you'd like<br/><br/>
            
            Game is over when no one has cards left<br/>
            Players will be ranked in the order of which they got rid of all the cards<br/>

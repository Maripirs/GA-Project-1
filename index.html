          Rules of the game 
        </h2> 
        <p class="rulesText" >

            -The objective of the game is to run out of cards as soon as possible<br/>
            -Each player starts the game with 3 cards face down, 3 cards face up and 3 cards in hand<br/>
            -In a turn, the active player has to play a card on top of discard pile if possible<br/>
            -Rules for playing a card are:<br/>
            - if there are no cards in discard. you can play any card<br/>
            - Otherwise play a card that has a higher value than the card on top of the discard pile (highest card for this game is A)<br/>
            
            ----after playing a card, if you have fewer than 3 cards in your hand AND there are cards left on the deck, draw a card<br/>
            -If you can't play a card, you'll collect the discard pile into your hand, the previous player gets to go again<br/>
            -you can only play cards from the table face up when your hand is empty<br/>
            -you can only play face down cards when you don't have any face up cards left nor cards in your hand<br/>
            ---playing facedown cards is always a gamble, you don't get to see them before choosing which one to play. if it's not a valid move, add it to you hand, collect the discard and previous player gets to go again<br/>
            Special situations:
            - 2 can be played regardless of the number on top of discard. Then play another card<br/>
            - 10 can be played regardles of the number on top of discard AND it will get rid of current discard pile (trashed). Then play a another card<br/>
            - if the top of the discard pile has 3 continuous cards of the same value, the discard pile gets trashed and current player gets another turn.<br/>
            
            Players will be ranked in the order of which they got rid of all the cards
